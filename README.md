Two numbers n and m are given. Create a two-dimensional array A[n][m], fill it with the multiplication table A[i][j]=i*j, and display it on the screen. In this case, nested loops cannot be used; the entire array filling must be done in one loop.

Specifications Input The program receives as input two numbers and m - the number of rows and columns, respectively.

Output The program must display the resulting arrayâ€”separate numbers with one space.
